# VR Chemistry Lab 🧪🌌

Welcome to the VR Chemistry Lab! This Unity-developed project brings chemistry experiments into an immersive virtual reality environment, designed for both educational and entertainment purposes. 

### ❗ Important Note  
Unfortunately, I cannot share the **project files** or the **game build** due to restrictions. However, I can provide **footage of the project** to showcase its features and functionality. If you're interested, feel free to reach out to view these materials.

## 📖 About the Project  
The VR Chemistry Lab was built to create an engaging and interactive platform for users to explore chemical reactions and experiments safely in a virtual environment. Whether you're pouring liquids to create reactions or observing molecular transformations up close, the experience is designed to provide a realistic yet creative laboratory setting.  

### My Role 🎯  
I focused on designing and implementing **the experimental experiences** and **the liquid behavior** in the VR environment.  
- **Experiences**: Ensured smooth, realistic, and interactive experimentation processes.  
- **Liquid Simulation**: Created realistic visuals and interactions for liquid substances, ensuring natural physics when poured, mixed, or manipulated.  


## 🎥 Features  
- **Interactive Chemistry Experiments**: Experience the thrill of mixing chemicals, observing reactions, and performing lab procedures with VR controllers.  
- **Realistic Liquid Behavior**: Designed to mimic real-world physics, including pouring, splashing, and mixing.  
- **Immersive Environment**: A highly detailed and responsive virtual lab space to enhance user experience.  

## 🛠️ Built With  
- **Unity**: Game development engine.  
- **VR Toolkit**: Integrated tools for virtual reality development.  
- **C#**: Scripting language for interactive features.
